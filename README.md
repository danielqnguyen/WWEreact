New Repository to test deployment

WWEQ stands for What We Eating?(Question Mark)

WWEQ was created because whenever my friends and I go out to eat we are never sure on where to eat just that we wanted to eat. I always had the idea of doing a food randomizer but my original idea was to use note/flash card, but why bring extra items with you when what is the one item someone will usually have on them, thats right a phone. Currently this just a web application.

There are a few food randomziers out there but they are all very simple with a roulette with just a name. I wanted to make something different.

WWEQ is made using ReactJs, C# was originally used for the backend but it was removed because it was deemed unnecssary for the project. The backend may come back if I plan to add a profile page or something of the sorts.

#Features I Plan to Add

-Twillo/SMS service to text the end results to your friends if you arent with them.

-Top Ten List based on the area

-Instead of pressing the pause button it will stop on its own and will ask if you like the choice and send you to the information page

-Open to suggestions

-TDB
